    ## Introudction
    
    Introduction:
The task steps have been fulfilled with the best of my knowledge. My nodes are with following IPS .
   1.	Master 192.168.1.11
   2.	Node01 192.168.1.12
   3.	Ubunut-k8s 192.168.1.74  (target node for ansible)
I used master node for all the activites and used the same VM to deploy the cluster on Ubuntu-k8s node. I installed Jenkins on my window machine for saving the resources for all three nodes. I added Master server as an agent in Jenkins server to run the code on it. I used Ansible, Jenkins, Git, xmobaterm, Argocd, Docker engine, kubernetes, Visual Studio Code for completing the assignment.
 
 The Idea of my Continues integration and Continues Delivery is explained in the Picture.
